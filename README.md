# HoloMRVDemo

**Overview:**

HoloMRV is a carbon credit verification platform focused on agricultural monitoring and reporting. The application helps farmers register for carbon credit verification, provides real-time digital twin visualization of farm conditions, and generates evidence packs for carbon credit claims. It specifically targets rice farming operations and alternative wetting and drying (AWD) practices to reduce methane emissions.

The system combines satellite data analysis, carbon calculation algorithms, and comprehensive reporting to create verifiable evidence packages for carbon credit markets.
